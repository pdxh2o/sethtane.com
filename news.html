			      My latest large painting is part of an ongoing series I began in 1979 about this dislocation.
			      Living in and working in Portland while visualizing elements and realities of NYC's intensity has
			      always given me a curiously perverse thrill, a kind of best of both worlds. Although I spent my formative
			      years in and around New York, I also felt inexplicably drawn to the west from my earliest memories
			      and prefer it as a base of operations ...with my forays into the grit, density and overloads of the city taken in measured doses.<br/><br/>
			      
			      The background here is just off Route 14 near Dallesport, Washington overlooking the Columbia River. I was able to drive up a gravel road
			      and climb over the barbed wire fence wth my ladder to get just the right view and and sun angle to match my library of subeay entrance
			      refernece photos.
			      
			      Here are two interesting links to artist Martin Kippenberger's Metro-Net project of installations he began in 1993 of replica
			      subway stops in various cities worldwide. It appears other artists are also picking up where he left off:<br/><br/>

			      Thanks to all of you who have attended my exhibitions, visited this website, or I've met in my long series of adventures.
			      Many have asked for an easy way to be added to my email list so they can see new work and hear about upcoming exhibitions in a timely manner,
			      so I've added a "subscribe" button at the bottom of these pages.
			      I always update this website as soon as paintings are done by adding them in chronological order on the "work" page.
			</p>
			      The small oil painting on panel above is the third in a new series I've been working on about NYC food carts at night.
			      Although I was pretty whipped from long days in the hectic city, I headed out with my stepladder (for a better point of view)
			      on the subways and streets until way past midnight during a hot week this June. This scene and the one below were some of many that made it worth the effort. 
			      After capturing the activity in the painting below, I walked from there to the jammed-to-the-walls throng and general madness in the blocks around Times Square,
			      where even heavily armed security forces ignored me while I was perched on a ladder on the sidewalk, or after climbing on a trash
			      bin when I couldn't deploy the ladder: photographing, waiting and photographing to capture as many people and their
			      interactions as I could for reference when I'm three thousand miles away in Portland trying to paint about it.

			      This cart was outside the New York Times building at the corner of 8th avenue and 40th street in Manhattan.
			      While I watched from the shadows of the Times building,
			      the operator of the cart would step out and talk with the three men in front of it, who all seemed to know one another well
			      or maybe were co-owners. Their discussion would lazily flow up and down the sidewalk in between his ducking back inside to
			      serve the few customers who would stop and order, and it seemed to be a way for them to break up the reality of hard work in
			      that small space on the corner until 4AM every day.
