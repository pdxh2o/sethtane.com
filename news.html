			      2 a T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18'h x 26'w x 5'd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steel and cedar
			      </p>
			<p>
			      When I was in my mid teens I wanted to be the next David Smith and learned how to cut and weld steel with an oxy-acetylene torch in a rented garage/studio.
			      Eventually my 3D work became assemblage boxes that can be seen in the early  <a href="http://www.sethtane.com/work/1970.php/">1970's</a> on my WORK page
			      (scroll down). Then I began to make painting my primary medium, partly because the burden of storage and transport of sculpture could be replaced
			      by the lightweight portability of painting. But during the years I rebuilt and lived on an old oil tanker in NY harbor I still accumulated a lot of
			      heavy duty tools, equipment and skills that were only added to by my later years as a manufacturer of marine deck structures for tugs and ships.
			      </p>
			<p>
			      I've always been interested in lattice structures, particularly crane booms and transmission line towers, assembled from small steel angle
			      but capable of carrying heavy loads. I recently found a nearby trove of industrial debris, including most of the elements that
			      inspired me to assemble this totem to my life on the water and in the woods. The process of singlehandedly fabricating parts and doing the rigging
			      and hoisting with my 1956 vintage crawler crane and slightly newer mini-excavator (sometimes in tandem) was an enjoyable challenge.
			      </p>
			<p>     
			      Here are some photos of the process:

			<p>     
			      Another recent 3D sidebar to my painting was last years's readymade sculpture of inverting my 3/4 yard clamshell bucket and pinning it to a buried
			      steel frame:

			      </p>    
			<p>    
			      But new paintings are still the main program, and here are two new 6-3/"4 x 10" oils on panel:

			      My latest large painting is part of an ongoing series of oils and a watercolor I began in 1979 about this dislocation.
			      Living in and working in Portland while visualizing elements and realities of NYC's intensity has
			      always given me a curiously perverse thrill, a kind of best of both worlds. Although I spent my formative
			      years in and around New York, I also felt inexplicably drawn to the west from my earliest memories
			      and prefer it as a base of operations ...with my forays into the grit, density and overloads of the city taken in measured doses for added stimulation as necessary.<br/><br/>
			      
			      The background here is just off state route 14 near Dallesport, Washington overlooking the Columbia River. I was able to drive up a gravel road
			      and climb over the barbed wire fence to wander through the rocky rangeland so I could get just the right point of view and and sun angle to match my library of subway entrance
			      reference photos.<br/><br/>
			      
			      The oldest visual reference I can find to this subject is the opening scene in Buster Keaton's 1922 classic film "The Frozen North":<br/><br/>

			      Here are two interesting links to artist Martin Kippenberger's Metro-Net project I recently learned about
			      of installations he began in 1993 of full size replica subway stops in various cities worldwide.
			      It appears other artists are also picking up where he left off:<br/><br/>

			      Thanks to all of you who have attended my exhibitions, visited this website, or I've met in my long series of adventures.
			      Many have asked for an easy way to be added to my email list so they can see new work and hear about upcoming exhibitions in a timely manner,
			      so I've added a "subscribe" button at the bottom of these pages.
			      I always update this website as soon as paintings are done by adding them in chronological order on the "work" page.
			</p>
			      The small oil painting on panel above is the third in a new series I've been working on about NYC food carts at night.
			      Although I was pretty whipped from long days in the hectic city, I headed out with my stepladder (for a better point of view)
			      on the subways and streets until way past midnight during a hot week this June. This scene and the one below were some of many that made it worth the effort. 
			      After capturing the activity in the painting below, I walked from there to the jammed-to-the-walls throng and general madness in the blocks around Times Square,
			      where even heavily armed security forces ignored me while I was perched on a ladder on the sidewalk, or after climbing on a trash
			      bin when I couldn't deploy the ladder: photographing, waiting and photographing to capture as many people and their
			      interactions as I could for reference when I'm three thousand miles away in Portland trying to paint about it.

			      This cart was outside the New York Times building at the corner of 8th avenue and 40th street in Manhattan.
			      While I watched from the shadows of the Times building,
			      the operator of the cart would step out and talk with the three men in front of it, who all seemed to know one another well
			      or maybe were co-owners. Their discussion would lazily flow up and down the sidewalk in between his ducking back inside to
			      serve the few customers who would stop and order, and it seemed to be a way for them to break up the reality of hard work in
			      that small space on the corner until 4AM every day.
