			      <i>Dollar Slice</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(in progress)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48 x 72"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oil on panel
			</p>
			I'll admit it, I'm no gourmet. I know the questionable ingredients, sub-optimal storage and preparation conditions added to the hectic surroundings don't make a
			foodie paradise for the knowledgeable, but street (and storefront) food is one of my favorite ways to get to know a place. It's hard to believe that at this late date there are
			still a fair number of places in Manhattan where you can get a big made-from-scratch slice of perfect thin crust cheese pizza for a dollar. This one is on 23rd street near 7th avenue
			and always has a hot just-out-of-the-oven pie being sliced into dissapearance and handed over the counter on paper plates to the line of waiting customers, no matter what time of day.
			      </p>
			<p>
			I've been looking at the best angles to capture this scene for a few years and had decided on the right time and angle on a trip to the city last November.
			Doing my normal race around circuit in and out of the city must have taken its toll on my already shot knees, resulting in a complete blowout of my left one and a near total loss of mobility at one point.
			I had to buy a cane and learn how to use it properly (it takes practice) just to get back to the apartment. Fortunately, after a little rest and some meds I was back in action
			carrying my stepladder down the street to shoot reference photos around 10PM on the only dry night of that week. As usual in New York, almost no one even looked at me perched on my
			ladder on the sidewalk. The shots were used to create a composite image that had all the characters, composition and dynamic feel I was looking for in one view.
			      </p>
			<p>
			I've always loved the light spilling out from the interior of Edward Hopper's <i>"Nighthawks"</i> and our view into the tableau at the counter from the darkness of the street.
			<i>Dollar Slice</i> captures a lot busier scene, but it's my tribute to that point of view and dramatic lighting. My paintings all begin with a complete rough underpainting as seen in the photograph above
			to establish the drawing, colors and values. Then I work over the entire painting bringing up the details, surface quality and blending that make oils my medium of choice.

			      <i>Miller Creek Local</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24" x 36"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oil on panel
			</p>
			      This painting combines the busy 6 train platform on 14th street in Manhattan with one of the hillside streams that runs in the wooded canyons surrounding my homestead only a few miles from downtown Portland.
			      It's a reminder that many of our modern transportation corridors and buildings followed former watercourses and other natural creases in the topography. In fact, Miller Creek is still shown
			      on many surveys, platt maps and records as "Water Road" leading to planned subdivisions that fortunately never came to be, at least here...instead, it remained a rarely seen stream in an undeveloped
			      part of Forest Park where native fish have now returned.</p>
			<p>
			      The former massive fill and small culvert under the highway where this stretch is located was replaced with a high bridge a few years ago, daylightling the fish run
			      for the first time in many decades. The electric inter-urban railroad that spanned the creek about a hundred feet upstream of this spot in the early 1900's is now long gone,
			      but the even older freight (and former passenger) spur line crosses it on a low trestle just downstream of the road bridge and still carries trains loaded with oil, logs and wood products daily. </p>
			<p>
			      Rising sea levels, record setting extreme weather, a global shifting of habitats and water resources...we are forced to acknowledge and adjust.
			      The dramatic images are everywhere. Flooded subways and neighborhoods after "superstorm" Sandy, the last few winters' mountains of snow and frigid temperatures in the northeast US,
			      and the searing droughts and wildfires elsewhere while the polar ice caps calve sub-continent sized chunks. These are unsettling and disruptive indicators of the consequences of our ant-hill
			      of activities and the unrelenting march of geophysical time. Few of us are willing to pay the price now of making major changes to our lifestyles and routines that might slow or delay catastrophe,
			      but we or our descendants will almost certainly pay later.     
			</p>
			      <br/>   
			<p>      
			      If you're in the Portland area, I've recently hung over 25 paintings in a great new shared workspace facility in the Pearl District located in a large historic building.
			      Please contact me directly for location and access information or stay tuned for an opening annoucement in April.

			      <i>Sea Train</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24" x 36"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oil on panel
			      </p>
			      This painting is another in my series of "Subway Surrealism" images that keep surfacing from the constant accumulation and viewing of
			      my experiences through the lens of art history. Seeing great paintings firsthand in the museums of New York was a key and
			      early influence on the development of my perspectives of the world at large. Getting next to the actual paintings remains one of my
			      favorite ways to see through the eyes and minds of others who wrestle with the simple tools of painting to try and make sense of the tumult around us. 
			      <p>
			<p>
			      The work of Rene Magritte remains one of my inspirations, and his painting <i>Time Transfixed</i> has always triggered a
			      mysterious thrill for me. <i>Sea Train</i> is my homage to the unsettling juxtapositions and inexplicable re-purposing that surrealism
			      makes such deft use of at its best...

			If you find yourself in the NYC subway in the next two weeks, a great mobile app based curated exhibit of subway art is up that features my paintings.

			      </p>
			
			<p>This multi-layered West Village wall caught my eye on one of my NYC walks a few years ago because it was a kind of historical map of the building's occupancies.
			The reflections in the blue glass of the modern cars parked on both sides of the street were disrupted by the missing panel, and the revealed window beneath looked into the dim past.
			It also served to obscure most of my reflection as I shot the reference photos.
			The adjacent storefront on the right is also the result of several different surface treatments over time to "update" it, and like the brick building on the left, the upper stories retained a much earlier appearance.</p>
			
			<p>This is another kind of "above and below" like that of the juxtaposition of surface life and the subways below ground that fascinates me as an illustration of the accumulation of human endeavors over the years, decades and centuries.
			I was equally attracted to the depth of layers visible inside the building on the right, where behind the reflections in the front window were interior rooms and walls and in the distance, a glimpse out the back door and across the next street over.

			<p>
			I have a hard time truly understanding the density of human activity represented by the evidence visible when flying over landscape.
			While ports, large industrial installations, mines and extraction fields are all impressive, the view of a city like New York can be overwhelming.</p>
			
			<p>As I painted <i>the Big Picture</i> I was mesmerized by the turbulent and intricate maze of life each tiny flick of the brush covered...even deep underground.
			The vast expanses of the west sometimes make me envision how big a city would fit in those views through the windshield, and how transformed that dusty ground would be with
			subway concession stands, dollar slices of pizza on the canyon-land street corners and millions of people rushing about intent on their glowing screens...

			<p>The two paintings above are part of a group of five new San Francisco street scenes based on images gathered on my many trips to the Bay.
			Please click on either one to see the others on my WORK page.</p>
			
			<p>
			I first went through the area in the summer of 1971 while heading back east to attend RISD after backpacking and hitchhiking on a summer trip through the west.
			I was on my way to catch a freight train in Portland and enjoyed a week or so admiring the Bay area's unique cities, scenery and topography. More recently I had the
			privilege of sailing in and out of the Bay on million barrel supertankers while serving as a federal court appointed monitor. Standing on the roof
			of the pilothouse inbound under the Golden Gate Bridge lit by a full moon as an outbound containership passes close by creates a whole new perspective.</p>
			
			<p>I have friends and relatives scattered around the Bay and the eleven hour drive from my home base in Portland is a frequent choice for a road trip
			to the relatively exotic variety of fun to be found there. Walking, riding and driving the streets of San Francisco, Oakland, Benicia and Berkeley always adds to my trove of memorable images and experiences. There is something special and
			well recognized about this part of California that is characterized by its own kind of golden light. The multi-ethnic street life and food choices available at all hours are set against a backdrop of visits to friends at start-up tech firms in the city and at the big shops in the Valley. It all makes my stays in the Tenderloin, Noe Valley and the Oakland hills as
			interesting and intense as my New York visits. I've got my habits and routines worked out now, which helps with navigation and getting the most out of these trips, so stay tuned for more paintings from them as time goes on...</p> 
			
			</p>
		  
			
			13 of my paintings are on display in a group show at the William Rolland Gallery in Thousand Oaks, CA (extended through October 2nd) <a href="http://www.callutheran.edu/rolland/" title="William Rolland">The Beautiful: Contemporary Images of America</a><br/><br/>

			<p>When I returned to painting full time I was transitioning from a mostly maritime career, first as a shipowner and later as captain of various vessels I used for towing, salvage,
			launch service and line handling on the working waterfronts of New York City, Charleston, South Carolina and Portland, Oregon. I also manufactured a line of composite deck structures
			for boats, ships and cranes which kept me in touch with other mariners to get them the pilothouses and control stations they needed for all those long hours at the helm.
			</p>
		        <p>I've always enjoyed being near big ships in small boats, and running a launch to and from ships anchored and underway is a challenging task.
			The currents and relative motions of the vessels, and the unpredictable actions of international crews going on or returning from shore leave can make it difficult, but the sensory rewards are many.
			The vivid colors and their reflections on the always moving water, smells of foreign cooking, snippets of other languages, and exotic home ports lettered on their hulls make each ship an island nation in the stream.
			</p>
			<p>From my studio in the forested west hills, I can see the lower Vancouver anchorage in the Columbia River near its confluence with the Willamette River, just downstream from Portland.
			When three or more ships are there I'm tempted to launch one of my kayaks or my outboard skiff and get close for new reference photos. These recent paintings capture some of those occasional visitors.

			      </p>
			<p>
			  These new small paintings are about my lifelong fascination with industrial subjects, especially at the nexus of oil & steel. Dick Bellamy's Oil & Steel Gallery
			  at 157 Chambers Street in lower Manhattan (1980-1985) was one of my frequent clients for rigging and transportation of heavy sculpture during the years I provided these
			  services to many artists, museums and galleries, although I was never fortunate enough to join the hallowed ranks of the artists exhibiting work there.</p>
			  
			  <p>
			      <i>Coalinga 148</i> is an image from a great detour through central California on my way back from delivering 13 paintings to the show north of LA last month.
			      <i>Tank Car</i> is from the rail line near my studio in Portland that has been seeing increasing numbers of long unit trains of Bakken crude from North Dakota
			      in transit to the terminal at Clatskanie, Oregon where it is loaded on vessels for transport down the Columbia River. The rapidly increasing volume of this traffic
			      and the route is cause for concern for many in the communities along the tracks who worry about the potential for catastrophic accidents involving the explosive product.

			  The above new paintings reference a recent extended trip to NYC in conjunction with my successful solo exhibition there. Six weeks of immersion in
			  that fast paced urban chaos provided a flood of imagery and observations that I worked to capture in video, still photographs and a slew of journal
			  entries to process, consider and catalog.</p>
			  
			  <p>
			      My return to the clean, green and quiet Pacific Northwest came after flying over the vast American landscape between the coasts in just a few hours.
			  That rapid transit of the entire country while in near continuous view always heightens the significance of travel and residency away from home for me.
			  It demands my reaction in paint.      
			</p>
			
			<p>     
			      The NYC show will be followed by a group show curated by Rachel T. Schmid at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, CA.
			      The exhibit runs from May 30th through September 11, 2014 and more than ten of my paintings are included.</p>

			      The simultaneous worlds of activity above and below ground, each usually unseen from the other, are connected by the maze of subways and trains that wind through them both.
			      This web of tunnels, bridges and tracks route us over and under each other, and we see each other briefly from one window to another in a passing train, next to or
			      across from us in a car, or waiting on a station platform. We begin our journeys alone and together, flowing from buildings to streets and then through turnstiles that lead to the trains,
			      riding in all our moods, in every season or time of day and night to our next stops. The buzz of our ceaseless activities and the silences in the gaps form the music that
			      accompanies our travels from one part of our lives to another as we watch the changing faces and places.
			      </p>
			<p>     
			      The images I continue to gather and use as portals into this tracked world are full of color, even in the darkest tunnels, and have mesmerized me since my first glimpses out
			      the front car window of the subway as a child. The paintings on this page and the rest of this series shown on my "work" page are small windows that become much more than
			      individual compositions when viewed in groups of above and below ground views. They become frames in a dynamic cross section of the bustle and tumult of our daily travels. 
			      </p>
			<p>
			      <b>Solo NYC Exhibit Invitation:</b> For all of you in or near the NYC area who would like a chance to view more than 30 of these paintings as they should be seen,

			      <i>2 a T</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2013 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18'h x 26'w x 5'd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steel and cedar
			      </p>
			<p>
			      When I was in my mid teens I wanted to be the next David Smith and learned how to cut and weld steel with an oxy-acetylene torch in a rented garage/studio.
			      Eventually my 3D work became assemblage boxes that can be seen in the early  <a href="http://www.sethtane.com/work/1970.php/">1970's</a> on my WORK page
			      (scroll down). Then I began to make painting my primary medium, partly because the burden of storage and transport of sculpture could be replaced
			      by the lightweight portability of painting. But during the years I rebuilt and lived on an old oil tanker in NY harbor I still accumulated a lot of
			      heavy duty tools, equipment and skills that were only added to by my later years as a manufacturer of marine deck structures for tugs and ships.
			      </p>
			<p>
			      I've always been interested in lattice structures, particularly crane booms and transmission line towers, assembled from small steel angle
			      but capable of carrying heavy loads. I recently found a nearby trove of industrial debris, including most of the elements that
			      inspired me to assemble this totem to my life on the water and in the woods. The process of singlehandedly fabricating parts and doing the rigging
			      and hoisting with my 1956 vintage crawler crane and slightly newer mini-excavator (sometimes in tandem) was an enjoyable challenge.
			      </p>
			<p>     
			      Here are some photos of the process:

			<p>     
			      Another recent 3D sidebar to my painting was last years's readymade sculpture of inverting my 3/4 yard clamshell bucket and pinning it to a buried
			      steel frame:

			      My latest large painting is part of an ongoing series of oils and a watercolor I began in 1979 about this dislocation.
			      Living in and working in Portland while visualizing elements and realities of NYC's intensity has
			      always given me a curiously perverse thrill, a kind of best of both worlds. Although I spent my formative
			      years in and around New York, I also felt inexplicably drawn to the west from my earliest memories
			      and prefer it as a base of operations ...with my forays into the grit, density and overloads of the city taken in measured doses for added stimulation as necessary.<br/><br/>
			      
			      The background here is just off state route 14 near Dallesport, Washington overlooking the Columbia River. I was able to drive up a gravel road
			      and climb over the barbed wire fence to wander through the rocky rangeland so I could get just the right point of view and and sun angle to match my library of subway entrance
			      reference photos.<br/><br/>
			      
			      The oldest visual reference I can find to this subject is the opening scene in Buster Keaton's 1922 classic film "The Frozen North":<br/><br/>
			      
			      <a href="/work"><img src="/aboutimages/Keaton.jpg" /></a><br/><br/>
			      
			      Here are two interesting links to artist Martin Kippenberger's Metro-Net project I recently learned about
			      of installations he began in 1993 of full size replica subway stops in various cities worldwide.
			      It appears other artists are also picking up where he left off:<br/><br/>

			      Thanks to all of you who have attended my exhibitions, visited this website, or I've met in my long series of adventures.
			      Many have asked for an easy way to be added to my email list so they can see new work and hear about upcoming exhibitions in a timely manner,
			      so I've added a "subscribe" button at the bottom of these pages.
			      I always update this website as soon as paintings are done by adding them in chronological order on the "work" page.
			</p>
			      The small oil painting on panel above is the third in a new series I've been working on about NYC food carts at night.
			      Although I was pretty whipped from long days in the hectic city, I headed out with my stepladder (for a better point of view)
			      on the subways and streets until way past midnight during a hot week this June. This scene and the one below were some of many that made it worth the effort. 
			      After capturing the activity in the painting below, I walked from there to the jammed-to-the-walls throng and general madness in the blocks around Times Square,
			      where even heavily armed security forces ignored me while I was perched on a ladder on the sidewalk, or after climbing on a trash
			      bin when I couldn't deploy the ladder: photographing, waiting and photographing to capture as many people and their
			      interactions as I could for reference when I'm three thousand miles away in Portland trying to paint about it.

			      This cart was outside the New York Times building at the corner of 8th avenue and 40th street in Manhattan.
			      While I watched from the shadows of the Times building,
			      the operator of the cart would step out and talk with the three men in front of it, who all seemed to know one another well
			      or maybe were co-owners. Their discussion would lazily flow up and down the sidewalk in between his ducking back inside to
			      serve the few customers who would stop and order, and it seemed to be a way for them to break up the reality of hard work in
			      that small space on the corner until 4AM every day.
